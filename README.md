👋 Hi, I’m Aytul

I’m a software developer with hands-on experience building and maintaining real-world applications across frontend, backend, and cloud environments. My work focuses on designing reliable systems, integrating APIs, and delivering features end to end with clean, maintainable code.

I primarily work with JavaScript, Node.js, React, and AWS, and I’m comfortable adapting to new tools and frameworks as project needs evolve. I’ve worked across web and mobile projects, contributed to both individual and team-based systems, and enjoy taking ownership of problems from design through to deployment.
